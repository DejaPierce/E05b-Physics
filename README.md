# E05b-Physics
This assignmemnt is all about collusions. In the first file you have to find a constant for gravity when has to be negative. The constant that I used for grativy is -9.81 which is the actual constant for grativy. For the next file you have to make the balls bounce. 
To make the balls bouce of the wall I made dx = dx and times in by -1 on lines 39 and 45. I did the same thing for dy on lines 51 and 57. For the third file you have to make the animals bounce off of each other. To do this you must make a temporary x equal a.dx, a temporary y equal a.dy, a.dx equals c.dx, a.dy equals c.dy, c.dx equals tx, and c.dy equals ty. All of the t's in this file means temporary, the c's stand for collusion, and the dx and dy are thw inital velocity.
